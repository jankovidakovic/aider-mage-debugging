## Debugging Mage-generated apps with Aider

This repository documents the debugging process of a Mage-generated blog application.
Debugging was done incrementally and interactively, using [`aider`](https://aider.chat/). 

### Starting point -- Blog app
The starting point is the initial commit, containing a Wasp application generated by [Mage](https://usemage.ai/).
The "Blog" template was used as the starting point, representing the most complex of the three templates.

### Chatting with aider to fix errors
After that, I chatted with `aider` and asked for fixes and improvements. 
Each incremental change was committed by aider, and a descriptive commit message was generated that describes the change.

### Documenting the debugging process
The commit message also includes logs of my interaction with aider at that specific time.
These logs indicate what prompt I used, what files were edited by aider, etc.
